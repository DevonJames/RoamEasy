# RoamEasy Tech Stack Document

This document explains, in everyday language, the technology choices behind RoamEasy. It shows how each tool and service helps build a reliable, user-friendly mobile app that plans multi-stop RV routes, suggests resorts, works offline, and keeps everyone on schedule.

## 1. Frontend Technologies

These tools power the app you see and touch on your phone.

• React Native (with TypeScript)

*   Lets us write one codebase that runs on both iOS and Android.
*   TypeScript adds simple checks to catch mistakes early, leading to fewer crashes.

• React Navigation

*   Manages how you move between screens (for example, from the map view to the resort suggestions).
*   Ensures smooth, predictable transitions and back-button support.

• Styling (built-in StyleSheet + custom components)

*   Uses familiar JavaScript objects to define colors, fonts, and layouts.
*   Supports our “bright, earthy tones” theme (soft greens, sunset oranges, ocean blues).

• Offline Storage (AsyncStorage or SQLite)

*   Saves maps, resort details, and your trip data right on your device.
*   Keeps your itinerary accessible even without cell service.

• Push Notifications (React Native Push Notification Library)

*   Triggers local reminders (for packing up or departure) based on your check-out times and prep durations.

• Accessibility Support

*   Large tap targets and scalable fonts for easier reading and tapping, especially on smaller screens.
*   High-contrast mode and screen-reader labels (voiceover support) powered by the ElevenLabs Conversation API.

**How these choices enhance your experience:**\
You get one consistent app on both platforms, easy navigation, clear visuals, and reliable offline access—all built with accessibility in mind.

## 2. Backend Technologies

These services handle your data, user accounts, and the heavy lifting behind route planning.

• Supabase (Authentication & Database)

*   **Auth:** Manages email/password signup plus Apple, Google, and social logins.
*   **Database:** Stores user profiles, trip plans, vehicle specs, and preferences securely.

• AI & Routing Engines

*   **GPT-4-Turbo (OpenAI API):** Helps interpret user preferences and rank resort options.
*   **Google Maps API:** Calculates routes and driving legs, shows maps and directions.
*   **OpenRouteService API:** Acts as a fallback routing engine if needed.

• Calendar Services

*   **Google Calendar API** and **iCloud Calendar API:** Let you export your trip as events into your personal calendars.
*   **iCal Export:** Creates a standard calendar file (.ics) for other apps.

**How these components work together:**\
When you plan a trip, Supabase keeps your info safe, the routing APIs compute your daily stops, GPT-4-Turbo suggests the best resorts, and the calendar APIs push events to your schedule.

## 3. Infrastructure and Deployment

This setup keeps our code organized, tested, and running smoothly.

• Version Control: GitHub

*   All code lives in GitHub repositories, so we can track changes, review work, and roll back if needed.

• Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): GitHub Actions

*   Automatically runs tests, checks code style (ESLint, Prettier), and prepares builds whenever we push updates.

• Development Environments

*   **Cursor:** AI-powered IDE extensions for faster coding and real-time suggestions.
*   **Replit:** Online IDE and collaboration space where we can prototype and demo features.

• Hosting & Services

*   Supabase’s managed servers handle authentication and database hosting—no servers for us to maintain.

**Why these decisions matter:**\
We catch bugs early, deploy updates safely, and keep services reliable—all without complicated server setups.

## 4. Third-Party Integrations

RoamEasy brings together several external services to deliver a seamless experience.

• Google Maps SDK & Directions API

*   Displays clean, interactive maps and computes driving routes.

• OpenRouteService API

*   Provides routing backup and alternative path calculations.

• Google Calendar API, iCloud Calendar API, iCal Export

*   Helps you sync trip events into your personal calendar apps.

• ElevenLabs Conversation API

*   Powers voiceover support and any in-app spoken guidance.

• OpenAI GPT-4-Turbo API

*   Analyzes your preferences and ranks resort options based on ratings, scenery, and your vehicle needs.

• Stripe (or similar payment processor)

*   Manages subscription billing for the freemium model.

**Benefits of these integrations:**\
You get reliable maps, smart suggestions, calendar syncing, spoken assistance, and easy payments—all without leaving the app.

## 5. Security and Performance Considerations

We’ve built safeguards and optimizations to keep your data safe and the app fast.

• Security Measures

*   All API calls use HTTPS/TLS encryption.
*   User data is encrypted at rest in Supabase.
*   Supabase Auth handles secure token management for sign-in and social logins.

• Offline & Caching

*   Maps, resort details, and itinerary data are cached locally so you can access them without a connection.
*   We limit the size of offline map tiles to avoid filling up your phone.

• Performance Optimizations

*   Route calculations and map renders aim to complete in under 2 seconds on supported devices (iOS 14+, Android 10+).
*   We cache API responses (routes and resort data) to minimize repeated network calls and respect rate limits.

**Result:**\
Fast load times, minimal data usage, robust offline support, and encrypted data protect your privacy.
